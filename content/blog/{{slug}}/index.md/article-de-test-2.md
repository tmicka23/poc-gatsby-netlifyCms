The algorithm learns your preferences better that way. Plus, if you get in kind of a cool enough relationship, you can sort of follow each other and check out each other's kinks, you know? That just sounds like slavery with extra steps. I'm man enough to simply say, 'I'm going to poop', and I'd be honored to have Ron Howard involved. Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.

Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty! Just do the same thing here and we'll be fine! Oh my god, how could I not see this coming? My lust, my greed! I deserve thiiiiii- Ladies, let's get out of here. I haven't learned a thiiiiiing! Morty, I'm a drunk, not a hack. There's a lesson here and I'm not going to be the one to figure it out.

Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die. I love morty and i hope morty loves me. I want to wrap my arms around him and feel him deep inside me. Merchandise Morty, your only purpose in life is to buy & consume merchandise and you did it, you went into a store an actual honest to god store and you bought something, you didn't ask questions or raise ethical complaints you just looked into the bleeding jaws of capitalism and said 'yes daddy please' and I'm so proud of you, I only wish you could have bought more, I love buying things so much Morty. A price for everything.

And now, human music. boop beep boop... boop beep boop... Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty? There's like a-a billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode where Former President BUSH was their neighbor! Why'd you even rope me into this?! Stealing stuff is about the stuff, not the stealing.
