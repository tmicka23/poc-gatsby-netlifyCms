description: The algorithm learns your preferences better that way. Plus, if you
  get in kind of a cool enough relationship, you can sort of follow each other
  and check out each other's kinks, you know? That just sounds like slavery with
  extra steps.

There's pros and cons to every alternate timeline. Fun facts about this one â€“ It's got giant, telepathic spiders, 11 9/11s, and the best ice cream in the multiverse! This is Principal Vagina. No relation. I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit! Yeah. I can prove it mathematically. Actually, l-l-let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming, anyways. How do you saddle a fart?

You ask alotta questions Morty, not very charismatic of you. Then let me GET to know you! Cause he roped me into this! I'm not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe?

Right, Crocubot. So, you're half cold unfeeling reptile, half also cold equally unfeeling machine? Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call love is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. What, cover me in gasoline and spiders? Fine, yeah, I'm in. Well I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry.

It probably has space aids. Me irresponsible? All I wanted was for you to hand me a screwdriver! But instead you had me buckle down and make you a roofie juice serum, so you can roofie that poor girl at your school. W-w-w-w--are you kidding me, Morty?! You're really gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y'know your-you're a little creep, Morty! Your-your-your-you're just a little creepy creep person! Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh yeah you can't. They blew up. I'll tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time. Bunch of people runnin' around bumpin' into each other, got a guy up front says, '2 + 2,' and the people in the back say, '4.' Then the bell rings and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or somethin'. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. I know that's not a popular opinion, but that's my two cents on the issue.

25 shmeckles? I-I-I-I don't even know what that- what is that? Is that a lot? I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality you're as dumb as they come. Where are my testicles, Summer? Why'd you even rope me into this?!

Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood. Beth, your son is dying! Say good-bye! And that's why I always say 'Shumshumschilpiddydah!' Not MY fault this is happening.

Listen to your sister Morty; to live is to risk it all; otherwise you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there, how much of that did you hear? Oh, I'm sorry Morty, are you the scientist or are you the kid who wanted to get laid? You know what shy pooping is, Rick? Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge.

I don't think we can perform our new song, The Recipe For Concentrated Dark Matter for a crowd this tiny! Meeseeks were not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! How do you saddle a fart? I'm your worst nightmare, bitch!
